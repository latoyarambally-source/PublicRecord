Building the Public Record Together (Public Circle)
Welcome! Public Record is a collaborative effort to make the truth vrifiable and honesty rewarding. I believe that "integrity is what you do next," and would like to see that there are tools to prove it.\
How you can help:
Designers: Help make the "Registry" feel like a trusted clear public library for information. 
Engineers: Help refine the SHA-256 "Proof of Record" so its as seamless as sending a text. 
Thinkers: Help fine tune the reputation system so that "correcting the record" remains the most  valuable action a user can take.

Shared Values:
No Erasure: We keep the history of our thoughts visible so we can learn from them
Radical Honesty: We reward the courage it takes to say " I was wrong"
Neutrality: This is a tool for every citizen regardless of their views.
